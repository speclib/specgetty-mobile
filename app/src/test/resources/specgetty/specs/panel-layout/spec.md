# panel-layout Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change pad-every-view. Update Purpose after archive.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Panel content is inset from its border
Every view drawn inside the main panel SHALL begin one column right of the left
border and end one column left of the right border. The rule belongs to the
panel, not to the views, so a view added later inherits it without doing
anything.

This applies to both tab bars, the change table and its search prompt, the specs
list and its document, the properties list and its content, the markdown
documents, the change header line, and the placeholder for an unimplemented tab.

#### Scenario: A list row under the cursor
- **WHEN** a row of the change list is under the cursor
- **THEN** its highlight SHALL begin and end one column inside the border, in
  the same way the project picker already draws its selected row

#### Scenario: A wrapped document line
- **WHEN** a line of a markdown document is long enough to wrap
- **THEN** it SHALL wrap one column earlier than the border, leaving a blank
  column between the text and the frame on both sides

#### Scenario: A view added later
- **WHEN** a new tab or pane is drawn inside the main panel
- **THEN** it SHALL be inset without that view rendering any padding of its own

### Requirement: Nothing compensates for the inset on its own
No view SHALL add horizontal padding of its own on top of the panel's inset.
A view that indents itself as well would sit two columns in while its neighbours
sit one, which is the misalignment this change exists to remove.

#### Scenario: The project header
- **WHEN** the project header is drawn above the tab bar
- **THEN** its first character SHALL sit in the same column as the first
  character of the tab bar, of the table header, and of every row below it

#### Scenario: The empty state
- **WHEN** no project is selected and the panel shows the prompt to open the
  picker
- **THEN** that text SHALL begin in the same column as any other panel content

### Requirement: The nav bar is inset without breaking its fill
The nav bar SHALL indent its text by one column on each side while its
background continues to span the full terminal width.

#### Scenario: The nav bar at any width
- **WHEN** the nav bar is drawn
- **THEN** its first key hint SHALL begin one column in, the version at the
  right SHALL end one column in, and the background SHALL still be painted from
  the first terminal column to the last

#### Scenario: A status message replaces the hints
- **WHEN** a status message takes the nav bar's row
- **THEN** it SHALL be inset and filled by the same rule as the key hints

### Requirement: Tab content is drawn in its own border
The content of the active tab SHALL be drawn inside a border of its own, placed
directly below the tab bar with no blank row between them. The border SHALL
carry no title.

This border is in addition to the panel's, so the content is inset from the
panel border and again from its own.

#### Scenario: The change list
- **WHEN** the changes tab is active
- **THEN** the table and its header row SHALL be drawn inside the border, and
  the project header and the tab bar SHALL be outside it

#### Scenario: An open change
- **WHEN** a change is open on one of its artifacts
- **THEN** the artifact SHALL be drawn inside the border, and the change header
  line and the artifact sub-tab row SHALL be outside it

#### Scenario: The border is not a signal
- **WHEN** any tab is active
- **THEN** the panel's own border SHALL keep the colour and the meaning it has
  today, and the content border SHALL NOT change what it says about where the
  keyboard is

### Requirement: A label that names the content sits outside the border
A line that says what the content is, rather than being the content, SHALL be
drawn above the border alongside the tab bar. A line that reports on the content
SHALL be drawn inside it.

#### Scenario: The config tab's source file
- **WHEN** the config tab shows a file
- **THEN** the dimmed line naming that file SHALL sit above the border, with the
  tab bar

#### Scenario: The change list's search prompt
- **WHEN** a filter is being typed or is applied to the change list
- **THEN** the prompt and its count of matching rows SHALL sit inside the
  border, under the table it describes

### Requirement: The border costs rows, not correctness
The content region SHALL shrink by two rows and four columns to make room for
the border and its inset, and every view SHALL still fit the terminal exactly.

#### Scenario: At the smallest supported terminal
- **WHEN** the terminal is 60 by 20, the smallest specgetty draws at
- **THEN** the frame SHALL still be exactly 20 lines and 60 columns, with the
  border drawn and fewer content rows inside it

### Requirement: A border is lit when the keyboard is in the region it encloses
Every border in the frame SHALL be drawn in the active colour when the region
holding the keyboard lies inside it, and in the dim colour when it does not.
Borders nest, so more than one may be lit at once, and the innermost lit border
is the region actually receiving the keys.

#### Scenario: A single-pane tab
- **WHEN** the changes tab is active
- **THEN** the panel border and the content border SHALL both be lit, because
  the keyboard is inside both

#### Scenario: Two panes side by side
- **WHEN** the content is split into panes and one of them holds the keyboard
- **THEN** that pane's border SHALL be lit, every other pane's border SHALL be
  dim, and the panel border enclosing them SHALL be lit

#### Scenario: An open change
- **WHEN** a change is open
- **THEN** the panel border and the artifact's border SHALL both be lit

#### Scenario: A modal
- **WHEN** a modal is awaiting an answer
- **THEN** it replaces the frame rather than being drawn over it, so no border
  underneath it is on screen to be lit or dimmed
