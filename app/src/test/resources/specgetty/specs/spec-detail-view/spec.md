# spec-detail-view Specification

## Purpose
Describes reading one specification as the structure it already has: an outline
of its Purpose, its requirements and their scenarios, beside a card that shows
whichever of them the reader is on, and what happens when a file does not fit
that structure.

## Requirements

### Requirement: A spec opens in a view of its own
Pressing `enter` on a spec in the specs tab SHALL open that spec in a view one
level below the project view, and `esc` SHALL return to the specs tab with the
same spec selected. This is the rule the change list already follows, applied to
a second list.

#### Scenario: Opening a spec
- **GIVEN** the specs tab is active and its list holds the keyboard
- **WHEN** the user presses `enter`
- **THEN** the selected spec SHALL open in the spec detail view

#### Scenario: Leaving the view
- **WHEN** the user presses `esc` in the spec detail view
- **THEN** the specs tab SHALL be shown again with the same spec selected

#### Scenario: Enter goes no deeper
- **WHEN** the user presses `enter` in the spec detail view
- **THEN** nothing SHALL happen, because the view is the floor of that branch

#### Scenario: The view names the spec
- **WHEN** the spec detail view is open
- **THEN** the name of the spec SHALL be on screen, so the view is never
  anonymous

### Requirement: The view is an outline beside a card
The spec detail view SHALL draw two halves, an outline of the spec on the left
and a card on the right, each in its own border, and `tab` SHALL move the
keyboard between them. The half holding the keyboard SHALL be the lit one. This
is the focus model the specs tab and the properties tab already use.

#### Scenario: Default focus
- **WHEN** the spec detail view opens
- **THEN** the outline SHALL hold the keyboard

#### Scenario: Moving the focus
- **WHEN** the outline holds the keyboard and the user presses `tab`
- **THEN** the card SHALL hold the keyboard, and its border SHALL be the lit one

#### Scenario: Moving it back
- **WHEN** the card holds the keyboard and the user presses `tab`
- **THEN** the outline SHALL hold it again, there being only two places for it
  to be

#### Scenario: Leaving and returning
- **WHEN** the user leaves the view and opens the same spec again
- **THEN** the outline SHALL hold the keyboard again

### Requirement: The outline lists what the spec contains
The outline SHALL list the spec's Purpose, then each requirement in the order the
file gives them, with that requirement's scenarios under it in file order. A
requirement SHALL be distinguishable from a scenario by how it is drawn and not
by its indentation alone, because a wrapped label occupies the indentation the
level below it would use.

#### Scenario: The order is the file's order
- **WHEN** a spec with several requirements is opened
- **THEN** the outline SHALL list Purpose first and then the requirements in the
  order they appear in the file, each followed by its own scenarios in file order

#### Scenario: The levels are told apart
- **WHEN** the outline is drawn
- **THEN** a requirement SHALL be drawn differently from a scenario, and that
  difference SHALL survive a label wrapping onto a second row

### Requirement: The outline wraps a long label rather than cutting it
A label wider than the outline half SHALL be wrapped onto as many rows as it
needs. A node that occupies several rows SHALL be selected as one node: the
cursor SHALL cover every row it produced, and moving the cursor onto it SHALL
bring all of its rows into view.

#### Scenario: A label wider than the half
- **WHEN** a requirement title is wider than the outline half
- **THEN** it SHALL be wrapped onto as many rows as it needs, and no part of it
  SHALL be cut off

#### Scenario: The cursor covers the whole node
- **WHEN** the cursor is on a node that wrapped onto several rows
- **THEN** every one of those rows SHALL be highlighted

#### Scenario: A wrapped node at the edge of the pane
- **WHEN** the cursor moves onto a node whose last row is below the bottom of the
  pane
- **THEN** the outline SHALL scroll far enough that the whole node is visible

#### Scenario: One step is one node
- **WHEN** the user presses `j` or `k` in the outline
- **THEN** the cursor SHALL move one node, whatever number of rows that node and
  its neighbour occupy

### Requirement: Every node has a card
The card SHALL show the node the cursor is on, and what it shows SHALL depend on
the kind of node.

#### Scenario: Purpose
- **WHEN** the cursor is on Purpose
- **THEN** the card SHALL show the spec's purpose prose

#### Scenario: A requirement
- **WHEN** the cursor is on a requirement
- **THEN** the card SHALL show the text between that requirement's heading and
  its first scenario, and SHALL NOT show its scenarios

#### Scenario: A scenario
- **WHEN** the cursor is on a scenario
- **THEN** the card SHALL show that scenario's title and clauses

### Requirement: A scenario's card lays its clauses out
A scenario's content is raw text, and a clause is the shape that text usually
takes: one source bullet, `- **WHEN** the user...`. Where the card recognises
that shape it SHALL put the keyword on a row of its own with the clause indented
under it, rather than rendering the bullet as it stands. The title SHALL be bold,
a backticked span SHALL be highlighted, and the prose SHALL be left legible.

A clause keyword SHALL be drawn by its role rather than as one kind of word: a
condition, an assertion and a continuation SHALL be told apart. The keywords that
bind SHALL be drawn wherever they appear in a clause's text, by the same rule the
renderer follows everywhere else.

Recognising the shape is a presentation choice and not a condition of being
shown. Content the card does not recognise SHALL be drawn as prose, wrapped and
legible, in its place in the scenario. A clause written in a shape the card does
not lay out SHALL still have its keywords drawn, so that the structure the layout
could not give it is readable anyway.

#### Scenario: A clause is laid out
- **WHEN** a scenario clause is drawn
- **THEN** its keyword SHALL be on a row of its own and the clause text SHALL be
  indented beneath it

#### Scenario: A clause longer than the card
- **WHEN** a clause is longer than the card can show on one row
- **THEN** it SHALL be wrapped and every row after the first SHALL keep the
  clause indentation

#### Scenario: The keywords
- **WHEN** a clause opens with `GIVEN`, `WHEN`, `THEN` or `AND`
- **THEN** that keyword SHALL be drawn in the style its role carries, and a
  condition, an assertion and a continuation SHALL be distinguishable from one
  another

#### Scenario: Code spans
- **WHEN** a clause contains a span between backticks
- **THEN** that span SHALL be highlighted

#### Scenario: Content in an unrecognised shape
- **WHEN** a scenario's content is not in the shape the card lays out
- **THEN** it SHALL be drawn as wrapped prose rather than omitted

#### Scenario: A binding keyword inside a clause
- **WHEN** a clause's text contains `SHALL`, `SHALL NOT`, `MUST` or `MUST NOT`
- **THEN** that keyword SHALL be drawn distinctly from the text around it

#### Scenario: Keywords in prose the card did not lay out
- **GIVEN** a scenario whose clauses are written in a shape the card does not lay
  out, so its content is drawn as prose
- **WHEN** that prose is drawn
- **THEN** the keywords opening its lines SHALL still be drawn as keywords

### Requirement: The card fits its pane at any width
The card SHALL be legible at every terminal width the application supports. Its
decorative padding SHALL shrink as the pane narrows, so that the space the text
itself needs is never given away to decoration.

#### Scenario: A narrow terminal
- **GIVEN** two terminal widths
- **WHEN** the same scenario is shown in each
- **THEN** the narrower one SHALL give the clause text proportionally more of the
  pane than the wider one does, and no row SHALL run past the border

### Requirement: The card is a document viewer
The card SHALL behave as a document viewer, with the wrapping, scrolling,
position reporting and position retention that capability describes. Moving the
outline cursor to another node SHALL start that node's card at its first row.

#### Scenario: A node taller than the card
- **WHEN** a node's card occupies more rows than the pane and the card holds the
  keyboard
- **THEN** the user SHALL be able to reach its last row, and the panel title
  SHALL report the reading position

#### Scenario: Moving to another node
- **WHEN** a card has been scrolled and the user selects another node
- **THEN** the new node's card SHALL be shown from its first row

#### Scenario: Position reported only when the card has the keyboard
- **WHEN** the outline holds the keyboard
- **THEN** the panel title SHALL show no scroll position

### Requirement: The spec is parsed when it is opened
Nothing SHALL be parsed until a spec is opened, and the result SHALL be held for
as long as that spec is open rather than derived again for each frame.

#### Scenario: A session that never opens a spec
- **WHEN** the application runs without the spec detail view being opened
- **THEN** no spec SHALL have been parsed

#### Scenario: Redrawing costs nothing
- **WHEN** the view is redrawn without the open spec having changed on disk
- **THEN** the spec SHALL NOT be parsed again

### Requirement: The reading position survives a rescan
The spec on disk can be rewritten while it is being read. The outline cursor
SHALL be kept by which node it is on rather than by its position in the list, so
that an edit above the cursor does not move the reader.

#### Scenario: An edit above the cursor
- **GIVEN** the cursor is on a scenario and the spec is rewritten with a new
  requirement added above it
- **WHEN** the view is redrawn from the new content
- **THEN** the cursor SHALL still be on the same scenario

#### Scenario: The node is gone
- **WHEN** the node the cursor was on no longer exists in the rewritten spec
- **THEN** the cursor SHALL land on a node that does exist rather than out of
  range

### Requirement: The arrow keys stay inside the spec detail view
`left` and `right` SHALL do nothing in the spec detail view. The view shows one
spec and has no sibling view to move between, and its two halves are reached
with `tab`.

Neither key SHALL change the project tab bar, and neither SHALL move the
keyboard between the outline and the card. This is the rule
`change-list-view` already states for an open change, applied to the level below
it: a level's keys belong to that level and do not spill into the one above.

#### Scenario: Right arrow in the spec detail view
- **WHEN** the spec detail view is open and the user presses `right`
- **THEN** nothing SHALL happen, and the tab that will be active on returning to
  the specs tab SHALL be unchanged

#### Scenario: Left arrow in the spec detail view
- **WHEN** the spec detail view is open and the user presses `left`
- **THEN** nothing SHALL happen, and the tab that will be active on returning to
  the specs tab SHALL be unchanged

#### Scenario: The keyboard stays where it was
- **GIVEN** the card holds the keyboard in the spec detail view
- **WHEN** the user presses `left` or `right`
- **THEN** the card SHALL still hold the keyboard, and the lit border SHALL not
  move

#### Scenario: Returning to the specs tab
- **GIVEN** the user has pressed `left` or `right` any number of times in the
  spec detail view
- **WHEN** the user presses `esc`
- **THEN** the specs tab SHALL be the active tab, as it is when the keys were
  never pressed

### Requirement: The structure read is the structure OpenSpec defines
The view SHALL read a spec by the same rules OpenSpec's own parser uses, so that
a file specgetty can structure is a file the rest of the toolchain can read.
Those rules are: the requirements of a main spec live under a `## Requirements`
heading; a requirement is a `### Requirement: <name>` heading inside that
section; a scenario is any level-four heading with content under it; a heading
inside a fenced code block is not a heading; and a delta header in a main spec
is an error, because it truncates the section OpenSpec parses.

specgetty SHALL NOT add a rule of its own to this set. Where OpenSpec is silent,
as it is about how a scenario's content is written, the view SHALL accept what
it is given rather than require a convention no tool enforces.

#### Scenario: Requirements outside the requirements section
- **GIVEN** a main spec with `### Requirement:` headings that are not inside a
  `## Requirements` section
- **WHEN** the spec is opened
- **THEN** it SHALL NOT be structured, because those requirements are invisible
  to `openspec validate`, `list` and `archive` as well

#### Scenario: A delta header in a main spec
- **GIVEN** a main spec whose requirements sit under `## ADDED Requirements`
- **WHEN** the spec is opened
- **THEN** it SHALL NOT be structured, and the reason SHALL say that a delta
  header belongs in a change

#### Scenario: A scenario heading without the Scenario prefix
- **GIVEN** a requirement containing a level-four heading whose text does not
  begin with `Scenario:`
- **WHEN** the spec is opened
- **THEN** that heading SHALL be a scenario, named by its heading text, because
  that is what OpenSpec counts

#### Scenario: A scenario heading with nothing under it
- **WHEN** a level-four heading has no content before the next heading
- **THEN** it SHALL NOT be a scenario, because OpenSpec does not count it as one

#### Scenario: A heading inside a fenced code block
- **GIVEN** a spec with a fenced code block containing a line that begins with
  one or more `#` characters
- **WHEN** the spec is opened
- **THEN** that line SHALL be content, not a heading, and SHALL NOT end the node
  it sits in

### Requirement: A scenario's content is never dropped
A scenario's content SHALL be carried in full and in the order the file gives
it. No line of it SHALL be discarded for being written in a shape the clause
renderer does not recognise, because the shape of a clause is a convention and
not part of what OpenSpec defines.

#### Scenario: Clauses written without bullets
- **GIVEN** a scenario whose lines read `GIVEN ...`, `WHEN ...` and `THEN ...`
  with no list markers
- **WHEN** its card is drawn
- **THEN** every one of those lines SHALL be on the card

#### Scenario: A scenario written as prose
- **WHEN** a scenario's content is a paragraph carrying no keyword at all
- **THEN** that paragraph SHALL be on the card

#### Scenario: Clauses and prose together
- **GIVEN** a scenario holding both keyword clauses and a paragraph between them
- **WHEN** its card is drawn
- **THEN** both SHALL be present in the order the file gives them

#### Scenario: A separator is not content
- **WHEN** a scenario's content includes a horizontal rule
- **THEN** it SHALL be left out, being a separator in the file rather than part
  of the behaviour described

### Requirement: A file that does not fit the grammar opens as a report
`enter` SHALL descend into the spec view whether or not the file can be
structured. When it cannot, the view SHALL report every reason it found, each
with the line it is on, rather than a single summary. The report SHALL offer the
key that opens the file in an editor.

The reader SHALL NOT be left with one transient line for a file with several
faults, and the file SHALL remain readable as markdown on the specs tab above,
which is where it already is.

#### Scenario: Descending into a file that does not fit
- **WHEN** the user presses `enter` on a spec that cannot be structured
- **THEN** the spec view SHALL open showing why, and `esc` SHALL return to the
  specs tab with the same spec selected

#### Scenario: Every reason is given
- **GIVEN** a file with more than one fault
- **WHEN** its report is drawn
- **THEN** each fault SHALL be named, and none SHALL be omitted in favour of the
  first

#### Scenario: A reason names its line
- **WHEN** a reason concerns a particular line of the file
- **THEN** the report SHALL give that line number

#### Scenario: The report offers the editor
- **WHEN** a report is on screen
- **THEN** the key that opens the file in the user's editor SHALL be offered, so
  the fault can be repaired where it is

#### Scenario: The markdown is still reachable
- **WHEN** a spec cannot be structured
- **THEN** its whole file SHALL still be shown as markdown on the specs tab, so
  no content becomes unreachable
