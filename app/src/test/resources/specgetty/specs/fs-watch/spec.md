# fs-watch Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change inotify-auto-rescan. Update Purpose after archive.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Debounce rapid filesystem changes
The system SHALL debounce rapid filesystem events so that multiple changes within a short window (200ms) result in a single rescan.

#### Scenario: Burst of file writes
- **WHEN** multiple files are written within 200ms (e.g., editor save operation)
- **THEN** the system SHALL perform exactly one rescan after the burst settles

### Requirement: Watch new subdirectories dynamically
The system SHALL detect newly created subdirectories within the watched `openspec/` tree and add them to the watch set.

#### Scenario: New change directory created
- **WHEN** a new subdirectory is created under `openspec/changes/` while watching
- **THEN** the system SHALL add the new subdirectory to the watch set so that files within it are also monitored

### Requirement: Cross-platform filesystem watching
The system SHALL support filesystem watching on both Linux (via inotify) and macOS (via kqueue) using the fsnotify library.

#### Scenario: Running on Linux
- **WHEN** the application runs on Linux
- **THEN** filesystem watching SHALL use inotify and function correctly

#### Scenario: Running on macOS
- **WHEN** the application runs on macOS
- **THEN** filesystem watching SHALL use kqueue and function correctly

### Requirement: Auto-rescan on filesystem changes in the open project
The system SHALL automatically rescan the open project when any file or
directory within its `openspec/` directory tree is created, modified, or
deleted.

#### Scenario: File modified in the open project
- **WHEN** a project is open AND a file within its `openspec/` directory is
  modified
- **THEN** the system SHALL rescan that project and refresh the display

#### Scenario: File created in the open project
- **WHEN** a project is open AND a new file is created within its `openspec/`
  directory
- **THEN** the system SHALL rescan that project and refresh the display

#### Scenario: File deleted in the open project
- **WHEN** a project is open AND a file is removed from its `openspec/`
  directory
- **THEN** the system SHALL rescan that project and refresh the display

#### Scenario: An active filter survives the rescan
- **WHEN** a change list filter is active and a rescan is triggered
- **THEN** the filter SHALL remain applied afterwards

### Requirement: Watcher lifecycle follows the open project
The system SHALL watch the open project's content tree, and SHALL watch exactly
one project at a time. Where the content was resolved through a store
declaration, the system SHALL watch two trees: the store's `openspec/`, where
the content lives, and the originating repo's `openspec/`, where the declaration
that points at it lives.

#### Scenario: Project opened at startup
- **WHEN** the application resolves a project at startup
- **THEN** it SHALL begin watching that project's `openspec/` directory tree

#### Scenario: A store-backed project opened at startup
- **WHEN** the application resolves a project through a store declaration
- **THEN** it SHALL watch both the store's `openspec/` tree and the originating
  repo's `openspec/` tree

#### Scenario: The declaration changes
- **WHEN** the originating repo's configuration file is edited to name a
  different store
- **THEN** the change SHALL be noticed, the root SHALL be resolved again, and the
  watched trees SHALL follow the new resolution

#### Scenario: Switching project in the picker
- **WHEN** the user selects a different project in the picker
- **THEN** watching SHALL stop for every tree of the previous project before it
  starts for the newly selected one

#### Scenario: One tree when the two coincide
- **WHEN** the open project holds its own specs and changes
- **THEN** exactly one tree SHALL be watched, as today

#### Scenario: Application exit
- **WHEN** the application exits
- **THEN** every watcher SHALL be closed

### Requirement: The store registry is watched where it decides resolution
A project that declares a store resolves through the registry, which lives
outside every `openspec/` tree and so changes without any watched file changing.
The system SHALL watch the registry for such a project, so that a store
registered, removed or repointed while the project is open is noticed the way an
edit to the declaration itself already is.

A project that declares no store SHALL NOT watch the registry, the registry
being unable to change what such a project resolves to.

#### Scenario: A store registered while the project is open
- **GIVEN** an open project whose store declaration could not be resolved,
  because the store was not registered
- **WHEN** the store is registered
- **THEN** the project SHALL be read again, and its specs and changes SHALL be
  shown rather than the unresolved declaration

#### Scenario: A store repointed while the project is open
- **GIVEN** an open project resolved through a store
- **WHEN** that store's registered path is changed to another directory
- **THEN** the project SHALL be read again from the new path, and the watch
  SHALL move with it

#### Scenario: A project holding its own content
- **GIVEN** an open project that declares no store
- **WHEN** the watch set is established
- **THEN** it SHALL NOT include the registry

### Requirement: A change arriving during a scan is not lost
The watcher SHALL never block on a consumer that is busy, and a signal it cannot
deliver SHALL NOT be discarded. A filesystem change that settles while a scan is
already in flight SHALL cause another scan once that one completes.

#### Scenario: A change during a scan
- **GIVEN** a scan of the open project is in flight
- **WHEN** a file under a watched tree is written and the debounce settles
- **THEN** a further scan SHALL follow the one in flight, and the display SHALL
  come to show the written content

#### Scenario: The watcher is never blocked
- **WHEN** a signal cannot be delivered because the previous one is unconsumed
- **THEN** the watcher SHALL continue reading filesystem events rather than
  waiting for the consumer

#### Scenario: A quiet project scans once
- **GIVEN** no filesystem change during a scan
- **WHEN** that scan completes
- **THEN** no further scan SHALL follow it

### Requirement: A refresh of content already on screen interrupts nothing
Reading a project for the first time and re-reading one that is already on
screen are two different events and SHALL be presented as two different events.

The first happens with an empty screen, may search the whole filesystem, and is
the only thing the user is waiting for, so it raises the scan indicator and
answers no key but `q` and `ctrl+c`. The second happens with the content on
screen and the user's hands on the keyboard. Raising a modal over what is being
read, and discarding the keys pressed while it is up, makes the application
appear to stutter and lose presses at the exact moment the user is working
quickly.

#### Scenario: A rescan while a project is open
- **WHEN** the open project is read again, whether because a watched file
  changed or because the application asked for it after writing one
- **THEN** no modal SHALL be raised, and what is on screen SHALL stay on screen
  until the new content replaces it

#### Scenario: Keys during a rescan
- **WHEN** a key is pressed while the open project is being read again
- **THEN** it SHALL be handled, rather than discarded

#### Scenario: The first scan still says so
- **WHEN** the application is searching for projects and has none to show
- **THEN** the scan indicator SHALL be raised as it is today, and only `q` and
  `ctrl+c` SHALL be answered

#### Scenario: Repeated writes
- **WHEN** the user changes several things in quick succession, each write
  prompting a read
- **THEN** every keystroke SHALL take effect, and the display SHALL come to show
  the final state of the file
