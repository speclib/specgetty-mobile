## Purpose
Gives the change list a full-width view with selectable columns and an
open/archived/both filter, and puts a single change on its own navigation level
below it so the change's artifact sub-tabs and the project tab bar never share
keys.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: A change opens at its own navigation level
A change SHALL open at a navigation level below the change list. `enter`
descends from the list into the change, and `esc` returns to the list.

This capability describes the change list and the change below it. What lies
above the change list is defined by the project navigation and is deliberately
not constrained here.

#### Scenario: Descend from the change list
- **WHEN** the change list is displayed with a change under the cursor and the
  user presses `enter`
- **THEN** that change SHALL open at its own level, filling the panel, with its
  artifact sub-tabs

#### Scenario: Ascend from a change
- **WHEN** a change is open and the user presses `esc`
- **THEN** the change list SHALL be displayed with the same change still under
  the cursor

### Requirement: Artifact sub-navigation is scoped to the open change
Left and right arrows while a change is open SHALL move only between that
change's artifact sub-tabs, and SHALL NOT change the project tab bar.

#### Scenario: Right arrow at the last artifact sub-tab
- **WHEN** a change is open with the last artifact sub-tab active and the user
  presses right
- **THEN** the active sub-tab SHALL NOT change and the project tab bar SHALL NOT
  change

#### Scenario: Left arrow at the first artifact sub-tab
- **WHEN** a change is open with the first artifact sub-tab active and the user
  presses left
- **THEN** the active sub-tab SHALL NOT change and the project tab bar SHALL NOT
  change

#### Scenario: Tab bar keys belong to the change list
- **WHEN** the change list is displayed and the user presses left or right
- **THEN** the active project tab SHALL change

### Requirement: Change list occupies the full panel width
The change list SHALL be rendered as a table across the full width of the
detail panel, not beside an artifact viewer.

#### Scenario: Change list rendering
- **WHEN** the changes tab is active
- **THEN** the change list SHALL span the full panel width with a column header
  row, and no artifact content SHALL be shown beside it

#### Scenario: Cursor row
- **WHEN** the change list is displayed
- **THEN** the row under the cursor SHALL be visually highlighted

### Requirement: Change list columns are selectable
The set of columns shown SHALL be selectable through the config file and a
command-line option, with the option taking priority.

#### Scenario: Default columns
- **WHEN** no column selection is configured
- **THEN** the list SHALL show the change name, task progress as `done/total`,
  and the number of specs in the change

#### Scenario: Columns from config
- **WHEN** the config file names a list of fields
- **THEN** those fields SHALL be shown as columns in the order given

#### Scenario: Columns from the command line
- **WHEN** the application is started with `--change-fields=` naming a list of
  fields
- **AND** the config file also names a list of fields
- **THEN** the command-line list SHALL be used and the config list SHALL be
  ignored

#### Scenario: Unknown field name
- **WHEN** a configured or supplied field name is not recognised
- **THEN** the application SHALL report the unknown name and the valid names
  rather than failing silently

#### Scenario: Change with no tasks.md
- **WHEN** a change directory has no tasks.md file
- **THEN** the task progress column SHALL be empty for that row

### Requirement: Active and archived changes share one list
Active changes and archived changes SHALL be shown in a single list with a
filter selecting which are included.

#### Scenario: Filter modes
- **WHEN** the change list is displayed
- **THEN** the filter SHALL be in one of three modes: open only, archived only,
  or both, with the current mode visible

#### Scenario: Default mode
- **WHEN** the change list is first displayed for a project
- **THEN** the filter SHALL be in open-only mode

#### Scenario: Both mode
- **WHEN** the filter is in both mode
- **THEN** active and archived changes SHALL appear in the same list, and each
  row SHALL indicate whether it is active or archived

#### Scenario: No changes in the selected mode
- **WHEN** the filter mode selects no changes
- **THEN** the list SHALL state which mode is active and that it contains no
  changes

### Requirement: Actions operate on the row under the cursor
The archive, discard and export actions SHALL act on the change currently under
the cursor in the change list, whatever filter is applied.

#### Scenario: Action with a filter applied
- **WHEN** a filter is narrowing the change list and the user triggers an action
- **THEN** the action SHALL apply to the change under the cursor as displayed

#### Scenario: Archive action on an archived change
- **WHEN** the change under the cursor is archived and the user triggers archive
- **THEN** the system SHALL do nothing
