## 1. The parser

- [x] 1.1 Add `src/ui/specparse.go` with a node tree of Purpose, requirements and
      scenarios, each carrying its title and its body, and verify a unit test
      parses one hand-written spec into the expected tree
- [x] 1.2 Parse a scenario's clauses into keyword and text, joining a bullet with
      its continuation lines, and verify a test covers `GIVEN`, `WHEN`, `THEN`,
      `AND` and a clause that spans three source lines
- [x] 1.3 Report a parse failure when the file yields no requirements or a
      requirement has no scenarios, and verify tests cover both and that neither
      panics on an empty file
- [x] 1.4 Verify the parser accepts all 24 live specs in this repository, by a
      test that walks `openspec/specs/*/spec.md`. The counts named here, 140
      requirements and 428 scenarios, were true when this was written; the five
      changes shipped since have grown the corpus to 148 and 464, so the test
      asserts the relationships that must hold rather than today's totals, which
      would otherwise have to be edited by every change that touches a spec
- [x] 1.5 Give each node a path that identifies it across a re-parse, and verify a
      test finds the same node in a tree re-parsed from edited content

## 2. Inline markdown

- [x] 2.1 Highlight backticked spans in `renderInlineMarkdown` and drop the
      backticks, and verify a test shows the span styled and the marks gone
- [x] 2.2 Leave a line with an unclosed backtick unchanged, and verify a test
      asserts the rest of the line survives

## 3. The level

- [x] 3.1 Add `levelSpec` and make `enter` on the specs tab descend into it when
      the selected spec parses, from either half, and verify tests for both halves
- [x] 3.2 Make `enter` on a spec that does not parse set `statusMsg` and leave the
      level and the cursor alone, and verify a test asserts all three
- [x] 3.3 Make `esc` return to the specs tab with the same spec selected and the
      list holding the keyboard, and verify a test round-trips
- [x] 3.4 Make `enter` at `levelSpec` do nothing, and verify a test asserts the
      level is unchanged
- [x] 3.5 Hold the parsed tree for the open spec and drop it on `esc`, and verify
      a test asserts the parser runs once across several renders

## 4. The outline

- [x] 4.1 Add `specDetailSplit` at four tenths with a minimum, used by both the
      renderer and `docRegion`, and verify a test asserts the two agree at several
      widths
- [x] 4.2 Lay the outline out with wrapped labels, requirements in
      `sectionHeaderStyle` and scenarios in the normal style, and verify a test
      asserts a 63-column title wraps at width 30 and is not cut
- [x] 4.3 Map each node to its row range and highlight every row of the selected
      node, and verify a test asserts a two-row node is highlighted on both rows
- [x] 4.4 Scroll the outline so the whole selected node is visible, and verify a
      test asserts a node whose last row is past the bottom brings both rows in
- [x] 4.5 Move the cursor one node per `j` or `k` regardless of node height, and
      verify a test crosses a wrapped node in one step
- [x] 4.6 Keep the cursor by node path across a re-parse, and verify tests for an
      edit above the cursor and for the node disappearing

## 5. The card

- [x] 5.1 Render Purpose, a requirement's text and a scenario as the three card
      kinds, and verify a test asserts a requirement's card excludes its scenarios
- [x] 5.2 Lay a clause out with its keyword on its own row and the text indented,
      wrapping with a hanging indent, and verify a test asserts a 229-character
      clause wraps with every row after the first still indented
- [x] 5.3 Colour the keywords and reuse the inline styling for bold and code
      spans, and verify a test asserts a keyword and a code span are both styled
- [x] 5.4 Shrink the padding as the pane narrows by one formula, and verify a test
      asserts no row exceeds the pane at 70, 80 and 120 columns
- [x] 5.5 Feed the card through `currentDoc` keyed by project, spec and node path,
      and verify a test asserts moving to another node starts at the first row

## 6. The keys

- [x] 6.1 Add the `levelSpec` arm to `docRegion`, `docActive` and `splitTab`, and
      verify a test asserts the card reports its position only while it has the
      keyboard
- [x] 6.2 Make `tab` move the keyboard between the outline and the card, and
      verify a test asserts both directions. The task and the spec delta both
      named the log panel as a third stop; it was removed by
      `remove-the-log-panel`, which shipped between this being written and
      being built
- [x] 6.3 Teach `listPage`, `moveListCursor` and `gotoListEnd` the outline, with
      the page walking node heights until one pane of rows is covered, and verify
      tests for unequal heights and for all-one-row reducing to today's behaviour
- [x] 6.4 Add the `levelSpec` arm to `renderNavBar`, and verify a test asserts it
      lists `esc`, `tab` and the scroll keys with the card focused

## 7. Documentation

- [x] 7.1 Document the new level and its keys in README.md, and verify the keys
      listed match the ones bound in `renderNavBar`
- [x] 7.2 Add the change to CHANGELOG.md
