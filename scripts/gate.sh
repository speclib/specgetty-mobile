# The quality gate for this project. Run on its own, or via ship-change.sh.
#
#   1. nix flake check                     always
#   2. gradle build/test/lint/coverage     as soon as ./gradlew exists
#
# The gradle half runs inside `nix develop` so the JDK and Android SDK come
# from the flake rather than from whatever happens to be on PATH. Gradle needs
# network access to resolve dependencies, which a pure nix derivation does not
# get, so the build deliberately lives here and not in `checks`.
